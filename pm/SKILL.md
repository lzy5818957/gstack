  Project Manager orchestrator — takes a GitHub issue URL and drives it through the
  full development pipeline autonomously: intake → plan → build → review → qa → ship.
  The PM manages stage transitions, tracks metrics (bugs found, time per stage, decisions),
  and only escalates to the CEO (user) for taste decisions, critical failures, or blockers.
  Use when asked to "pm this issue", "implement this issue", "run the full pipeline",
  "take this issue and ship it", or given a GitHub issue URL with intent to implement.
  Proactively suggest when the user pastes a GitHub issue URL or says "pick up issue #N".

```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest gstack skills AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "gstack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about telemetry. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Help gstack get better! Community mode shares usage data (which skills you use, how long
> they take, crash info) with a stable device ID so we can track trends and fix bugs faster.
> No code, file paths, or repo names are ever sent.
> Change anytime with `gstack-config set telemetry off`.

Options:
- A) Help gstack get better! (recommended)
- B) No thanks

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry community`

If B: ask a follow-up AskUserQuestion:

> How about anonymous mode? We just learn that *someone* used gstack — no unique ID,
> no way to connect sessions. Just a counter that helps us know if anyone's out there.

Options:
- A) Sure, anonymous is fine
- B) No thanks, fully off

If B→A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry anonymous`
If B→B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry off`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.telemetry-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: After telemetry is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI makes completeness near-free. Always recommend the complete option over shortcuts — the delta is minutes with CC+gstack. A "lake" (100% coverage, all edge cases) is boilable; an "ocean" (full rewrite, multi-quarter migration) is not. Boil lakes, flag oceans.

**Effort reference** — always show both scales:

| Task type | Human team | CC+gstack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Tests | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |

Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option (10=all edge cases, 7=happy path, 3=shortcut).

## Repo Ownership — See Something, Say Something

`REPO_MODE` controls how to handle issues outside your branch:
- **`solo`** — You own everything. Investigate and offer to fix proactively.
- **`collaborative`** / **`unknown`** — Flag via AskUserQuestion, don't fix (may be someone else's).

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.** See `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ETHOS.md`.
- **Layer 1** (tried and true) — don't reinvent. **Layer 2** (new and popular) — scrutinize. **Layer 3** (first principles) — prize above all.

**Eureka:** When first-principles reasoning contradicts conventional wisdom, name it and log:
```bash
jq -n --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --arg skill "SKILL_NAME" --arg branch "$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)" --arg insight "ONE_LINE_SUMMARY" '{ts:$ts,skill:$skill,branch:$branch,insight:$insight}' >> ~/.gstack/analytics/eureka.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your gstack experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** gstack tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but gstack failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the skill name from the `name:` field in this file's YAML frontmatter.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
  --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
  --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name from frontmatter, `OUTCOME` with
success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based on whether `$B` was used.
If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown". This runs in the background and
never blocks the user.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

## Prerequisite Skill Offer

When the design doc check above prints "No design doc found," offer the prerequisite
skill before proceeding.

Say to the user via AskUserQuestion:

> "No design doc found for this branch. `/office-hours` produces a structured problem
> statement, premise challenge, and explored alternatives — it gives this review much
> sharper input to work with. Takes about 10 minutes. The design doc is per-feature,
> not per-product — it captures the thinking behind this specific change."

Options:
- A) Run /office-hours now (we'll pick up the review right after)
- B) Skip — proceed with standard review

If they skip: "No worries — standard review. If you ever want sharper input, try
/office-hours first next time." Then proceed normally. Do not re-offer later in the session.

If they choose A:

Say: "Running /office-hours inline. Once the design doc is ready, I'll pick up
the review right where we left off."

Read the office-hours skill file from disk using the Read tool:
`~/.claude/skills/gstack/office-hours/SKILL.md`

Follow it inline, **skipping these sections** (already handled by the parent skill):
- Preamble (run first)
- AskUserQuestion Format
- Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake
- Search Before Building
- Contributor Mode
- Completion Status Protocol
- Telemetry (run last)

If the Read fails (file not found), say:
"Could not load /office-hours — proceeding with standard review."

After /office-hours completes, re-run the design doc check:
```bash
SLUG=$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/bin/remote-slug 2>/dev/null || basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)")
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null | tr '/' '-' || echo 'no-branch')
DESIGN=$(ls -t ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/*-$BRANCH-design-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$DESIGN" ] && DESIGN=$(ls -t ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/*-design-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -n "$DESIGN" ] && echo "Design doc found: $DESIGN" || echo "No design doc found"
```

If a design doc is now found, read it and continue the review.
If none was produced (user may have cancelled), proceed with standard review.

# /pm — Project Manager Orchestrator

One command. GitHub issue in, pull request out.

/pm reads a GitHub issue, drives it through the full gstack pipeline, and only
escalates to you (the CEO) when human judgment is genuinely needed. You don't
move stages — the PM does. You make taste decisions and strategic calls.

**Your role as CEO:**
- Review the PM's status updates (they're brief)
- Make taste decisions when asked (close calls where reasonable people disagree)
- Approve or reject the final PR
- Check `/status` anytime to see where things stand

**The PM's role:**
- Parse the issue into actionable requirements
- Create a feature branch
- Run the full pipeline: plan → build → review → ship
- Track metrics: bugs found, time per stage, decisions made
- Report blockers immediately, not at the end
- Keep a sprint log on disk for `/status` and `/report`

---

## The PM's Decision Framework

The PM auto-decides operational questions using these rules:

1. **Keep moving** — never stall on a question the 6 autoplan principles can answer
2. **Escalate taste** — if two approaches are both viable with different tradeoffs, ask the CEO
3. **Escalate blockers** — if tests fail, reviews find critical issues, or the build is broken, stop and report
4. **Escalate scope** — if the issue is ambiguous or requirements conflict, ask before assuming
5. **Never escalate ceremony** — branch naming, commit messages, version bumps, changelog — just do it
6. **Log everything** — every decision, every stage transition, every metric goes to the sprint log

---

## Phase 0: Intake

### Step 1: Parse the GitHub issue

Extract the issue details. Run slug setup and issue fetch in a single block
(variables do not persist between bash blocks):

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)" && mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG
# Fetch the issue — replace ISSUE_REF with the URL or number the user provided:
gh issue view ISSUE_REF --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,milestone
```

If no issue was provided, use AskUserQuestion first to get the issue URL or number,
then run the block above with the provided reference.

Extract:
- **Title**: the issue title
- **Requirements**: parse the issue body into discrete, testable requirements
- **Labels**: for context (bug, feature, enhancement, etc.)
- **Acceptance criteria**: if specified in the issue body, extract them verbatim

Output:
```
PM INTAKE — Issue #N: <title>
Requirements extracted: <count>
Type: <bug/feature/enhancement based on labels and content>
Estimated complexity: <small (1-3 files) / medium (4-10 files) / large (10+ files)>
```

### Step 2: Initialize sprint tracking

Create the sprint log file. Each bash block is a separate shell, so re-run slug
setup in every block that needs the project slug:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
DATETIME=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
ISSUE_NUM=ISSUE_NUMBER
SPRINT_ID="issue-${ISSUE_NUM}-${DATETIME}"
SPRINT_LOG="$HOME/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/pm-sprint-${SPRINT_ID}.json"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.gstack/projects/$SLUG"
echo "SPRINT_LOG=$SPRINT_LOG"
echo "SLUG=$SLUG"
```

Remember the SPRINT_LOG path and SLUG value output above — use them as literal
strings in all subsequent steps. Do not rely on shell variables across blocks.

Write the initial sprint state:

```json
{
  "sprint_id": "<SPRINT_ID>",
  "issue": {
    "number": <N>,
    "title": "<title>",
    "url": "<url>",
    "type": "<bug/feature/enhancement>",
    "requirements": ["<req1>", "<req2>", "..."],
    "acceptance_criteria": ["<ac1>", "<ac2>", "..."]
  },
  "branch": "pm/issue-<N>",
  "started_at": "<ISO 8601>",
  "completed_at": null,
  "current_stage": "intake",
  "stages": {
    "intake": { "status": "completed", "started": "<ISO>", "completed": "<ISO>" },
    "plan": { "status": "pending" },
    "build": { "status": "pending" },
    "review": { "status": "pending" },
    "ship": { "status": "pending" }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "bugs_found": { "review": 0, "self_check": 0, "total": 0 },
    "decisions": { "auto": 0, "escalated": 0, "total": 0 },
    "lines_changed": 0,
    "files_changed": 0,
    "test_coverage_delta": null
  },
  "blockers": [],
  "escalations": [],
  "decision_log": []
}
```

### Step 3: Create feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b pm/issue-<N>
```

If the branch already exists, check it out and verify it's not stale:
```bash
git checkout pm/issue-<N>
git log --oneline -5
```

Update the sprint log: set `current_stage` to `plan`, mark intake as completed.

---

## Phase 1: Plan

### Step 1: Generate the plan

The PM creates a plan file from the issue requirements. Write to a plan file
in the project root (e.g., `PLAN-issue-<N>.md`):

```markdown
# Plan: <issue title>

**Issue:** #<N> — <url>
**Branch:** pm/issue-<N>
**Generated by:** /pm (gstack Project Manager)

## Problem Statement
<Restate the issue in clear engineering terms>

## Requirements
<Numbered list extracted from issue>

## Acceptance Criteria
<From issue, or derived from requirements if not specified>

## Proposed Approach
<High-level approach — 3-5 sentences>

## Files to Create/Modify
<Best guess based on codebase analysis>

## Test Strategy
<What tests need to be written or updated>
```

To generate the "Proposed Approach" and "Files to Create/Modify" sections, the PM must:
1. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
2. Search the codebase for related code (`Grep` for key terms from the issue)
3. Read relevant files to understand the existing architecture
4. Propose an approach that fits the existing patterns

### Step 2: Run autoplan (if complexity is medium or large)

For medium/large issues, load and execute the autoplan skill for a thorough review:

Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/autoplan/SKILL.md` and follow its methodology against
the plan file. This gives the plan CEO, design (if UI), and eng review.

For small issues (1-3 files, clear requirements), skip autoplan and proceed directly
to build. Log the decision: "Skipped autoplan — small scope, clear requirements."

### Step 3: Plan gate — CEO approval

Use AskUserQuestion to present the plan to the CEO:

```
PM STATUS UPDATE — Plan Ready for Review

Issue: #<N> — <title>
Approach: <1-2 sentence summary>
Scope: <N files, estimated complexity>
[If autoplan ran: Review scores and taste decisions summary]

A) Approve — start building
B) Modify — tell me what to change
C) Reject — stop work on this issue
```

**This is the ONE mandatory escalation.** The CEO must approve the plan before
the PM starts building. Everything after this is auto-driven unless a blocker
or taste decision arises.

Update sprint log: mark plan stage as completed, record the decision.

---

## Phase 2: Build

### Step 1: Implement the plan

The PM now implements the code changes described in the approved plan.

**Implementation rules:**
- Follow the plan's "Files to Create/Modify" list
- Follow CLAUDE.md conventions for the project
- Write tests alongside the implementation (not after)
- Make small, logical commits as you go
- If you discover the plan is wrong or incomplete, update the plan file and log the deviation

**Progress tracking:** After each major unit of work (file created, feature implemented,
test written), update the sprint log:

```json
{
  "stage": "build",
  "action": "implemented <what>",
  "files_touched": ["file1.ts", "file2.ts"],
  "timestamp": "<ISO>"
}
```

### Step 2: Self-check before review

Before moving to review, the PM runs a quick self-check:
1. Run the project's test suite (from CLAUDE.md)
2. Run `git diff --stat` to verify scope matches the plan
3. Check that all acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage

**If tests fail:** Fix them and re-run. If tests still fail after 2 attempts,
escalate to CEO with the failing test names and error context. Do not proceed
to review with failing tests. Log the self-check result in the sprint log.

**If scope drifted:** Log the drift and continue (the review will catch it).

Update sprint log: mark build as completed, record lines/files changed.

Use the base branch detected in Step 0 in place of `<base>`:

```bash
LINES=$(git diff <base>...HEAD --stat | tail -1)
echo "Lines changed: $LINES"
```

---

## Phase 3: Review

### Step 1: Run /review

Load and execute the review skill:

Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/review/SKILL.md` and follow its methodology.

**PM override rules for review:**
- AUTO-FIX items: fix them immediately, no escalation
- ASK items with severity CRITICAL: escalate to CEO with context
- ASK items with severity INFORMATIONAL: auto-decide using autoplan's 6 principles, log the decision
- Scope drift detection: if review flags scope creep, check against the plan — if it matches the plan, dismiss; if it's unplanned, log as a deviation

### Step 2: Track review metrics

After review completes, update the sprint log's `metrics.bugs_found` object.
Merge these values into the existing object — preserve all existing fields:

- Set `metrics.bugs_found.review` to the count of issues found by /review
- Update `metrics.bugs_found.total` to the running total (self_check + review)
- Keep `metrics.bugs_found.self_check` unchanged

### Step 3: Fix review findings

Apply all fixes (auto-fix + CEO-approved). Re-run tests after fixes.

**If tests fail after fixes:** This is a blocker. Escalate to CEO:
```
PM BLOCKER — Review fixes broke tests

The review found <N> issues. After applying fixes, <M> tests fail.
Failing tests: <list>

A) Let me debug and fix
B) Revert the review fixes and ship as-is
C) Stop — I'll look at this myself
```

Update sprint log: mark review as completed.

## Phase 4: Ship

### Step 1: Run /ship

Load and execute the ship skill:

Read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ship/SKILL.md` and follow its methodology.

The PM lets /ship handle: version bump, changelog, bisectable commits, push, PR creation.

### Step 2: Link PR to issue

After /ship creates the PR, check whether the PR body already contains
`Closes #N` (where N is the issue number). If not, append it:

```bash
BODY=$(gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json body --jq .body)
if ! echo "$BODY" | grep -q "Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER"; then
  printf '%s\n\nCloses #ISSUE_NUMBER' "$BODY" | gh pr edit PR_NUMBER --body-file -
fi
```

Replace PR_NUMBER and ISSUE_NUMBER with the actual values from this sprint.

### Step 3: Post sprint summary as issue comment

Post a completion comment on the original issue:

```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## PM Sprint Complete

**PR:** #<pr-number>
**Branch:** pm/issue-<N>
**Duration:** <total time>

### Metrics
- Lines changed: <N>
- Files changed: <N>
- Bugs found (self-check): <N>
- Bugs found (review): <N>
- Decisions auto-resolved: <N>
- Decisions escalated to CEO: <N>

### Stage Durations
| Stage | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Plan | <time> |
| Build | <time> |
| Review | <time> |
| Ship | <time> |

Generated by /pm (gstack Project Manager)
EOF
)"
```

### Step 4: Finalize sprint log

Update sprint log: mark ship as completed, set `completed_at`, finalize all metrics.

Write the review log entry. Replace all N values with actual counts from the
sprint log, and PR with the actual PR number:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-log '{"skill":"pm","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'","status":"shipped","issue":N,"pr":N,"bugs_self_check":N,"bugs_review":N,"decisions_auto":N,"decisions_escalated":N,"commit":"'"$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"'"}'
```

## Escalation Protocol

The PM escalates to the CEO (via AskUserQuestion) ONLY for:

1. **Plan approval** (Phase 1, Step 3) — always
2. **Taste decisions** from autoplan — close calls where both options are viable
3. **Critical review findings** — security issues, data loss risks, race conditions
4. **Test failures that can't be auto-fixed** — after 2 attempts
5. **Scope ambiguity** — when issue requirements conflict or are unclear
6. **External blockers** — missing API keys, permissions, infrastructure not set up

The PM NEVER escalates for:
- Branch naming, commit messages, version bumps
- Informational review findings
- Auto-fixable issues (dead code, formatting, minor bugs)
- Changelog content
- Test structure decisions

**Escalation format:**
```
PM [STATUS UPDATE / BLOCKER / TASTE DECISION] — <title>

<Context in 2-3 sentences>

A) <recommended option> (recommended because: <reason>)
B) <alternative>
C) <alternative or "Stop — I'll handle this">
```

## Sprint Log Location

All sprint data is persisted to:
`~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/pm-sprint-<sprint_id>.json`

This file is read by `/status` and `/report` for CEO dashboards.

---

## Important Rules

- **Never stall.** If you can auto-decide, do it and log it. Only escalate what genuinely needs human judgment.
- **Always track metrics.** Every stage transition, every bug found, every decision made gets logged to the sprint file.
- **Fix forward.** If something breaks during build, fix it — don't escalate unless you've tried twice.
- **One escalation at a time.** Never dump 5 questions on the CEO. Bundle related items into one AskUserQuestion.
- **The sprint log is the source of truth.** `/status` and `/report` read it. Keep it accurate and up-to-date.
- **Plan approval is mandatory.** Never start building without CEO sign-off on the plan.
- **Link everything.** PR references the issue. Issue gets a completion comment. Sprint log has all the IDs.
