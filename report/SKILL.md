echo '{"skill":"report","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true

```

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest gstack skills AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "gstack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero. Read more: https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean"
Then offer to open the essay in their default browser:

```bash
open https://garryslist.org/posts/boil-the-ocean
touch ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Only run `open` if the user says yes. Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about telemetry. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Help gstack get better! Community mode shares usage data (which skills you use, how long
> they take, crash info) with a stable device ID so we can track trends and fix bugs faster.
> No code, file paths, or repo names are ever sent.
> Change anytime with `gstack-config set telemetry off`.

Options:
- A) Help gstack get better! (recommended)
- B) No thanks

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry community`

If B: ask a follow-up AskUserQuestion:

> How about anonymous mode? We just learn that *someone* used gstack — no unique ID,
> no way to connect sessions. Just a counter that helps us know if anyone's out there.

Options:
- A) Sure, anonymous is fine
- B) No thanks, fully off

If B→A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry anonymous`
If B→B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry off`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.telemetry-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: After telemetry is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch (use the `_BRANCH` value printed by the preamble — NOT any branch from conversation history or gitStatus), and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow. No raw function names, no internal jargon, no implementation details. Use concrete examples and analogies. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` — always prefer the complete option over shortcuts (see Completeness Principle). Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option. Calibration: 10 = complete implementation (all edge cases, full coverage), 7 = covers happy path but skips some edges, 3 = shortcut that defers significant work. If both options are 8+, pick the higher; if one is ≤5, flag it.
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...` — when an option involves effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X / CC: ~Y)`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open. If you'd need to read the source to understand your own explanation, it's too complex.

Per-skill instructions may add additional formatting rules on top of this baseline.

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake

AI makes completeness near-free. Always recommend the complete option over shortcuts — the delta is minutes with CC+gstack. A "lake" (100% coverage, all edge cases) is boilable; an "ocean" (full rewrite, multi-quarter migration) is not. Boil lakes, flag oceans.

**Effort reference** — always show both scales:

| Task type | Human team | CC+gstack | Compression |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Boilerplate | 2 days | 15 min | ~100x |
| Tests | 1 day | 15 min | ~50x |
| Feature | 1 week | 30 min | ~30x |
| Bug fix | 4 hours | 15 min | ~20x |

Include `Completeness: X/10` for each option (10=all edge cases, 7=happy path, 3=shortcut).

## Repo Ownership — See Something, Say Something

`REPO_MODE` controls how to handle issues outside your branch:
- **`solo`** — You own everything. Investigate and offer to fix proactively.
- **`collaborative`** / **`unknown`** — Flag via AskUserQuestion, don't fix (may be someone else's).

Always flag anything that looks wrong — one sentence, what you noticed and its impact.

## Search Before Building

Before building anything unfamiliar, **search first.** See `~/.claude/skills/gstack/ETHOS.md`.
- **Layer 1** (tried and true) — don't reinvent. **Layer 2** (new and popular) — scrutinize. **Layer 3** (first principles) — prize above all.

**Eureka:** When first-principles reasoning contradicts conventional wisdom, name it and log:
```bash
jq -n --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --arg skill "SKILL_NAME" --arg branch "$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)" --arg insight "ONE_LINE_SUMMARY" '{ts:$ts,skill:$skill,branch:$branch,insight:$insight}' >> ~/.gstack/analytics/eureka.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your gstack experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** gstack tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but gstack failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.gstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the skill name from the `name:` field in this file's YAML frontmatter.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
  --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
  --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name from frontmatter, `OUTCOME` with
success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based on whether `$B` was used.
If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown". This runs in the background and
never blocks the user.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First, detect the git hosting platform from the remote URL:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

**If GitHub:**
1. `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName` — if succeeds, use it
2. `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` — if succeeds, use it

**If GitLab:**
1. `glab mr view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `target_branch` field — if succeeds, use it
2. `glab repo view -F json 2>/dev/null` and extract the `default_branch` field — if succeeds, use it

**Git-native fallback (if unknown platform, or CLI commands fail):**
1. `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'`
2. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/main 2>/dev/null` → use `main`
3. If that fails: `git rev-parse --verify origin/master 2>/dev/null` → use `master`

If all fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name. In every subsequent `git diff`, `git log`,
`git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation command, substitute the detected
branch name wherever the instructions say "the base branch" or `<default>`.

# /report — Sprint Report for CEO

Detailed analysis of PM sprint performance. Unlike `/status` (quick glance),
`/report` digs into the data: where bugs were caught, how long each stage took,
which decisions were escalated, and how the team is trending over time.

---

## Step 1: Gather all sprint data

Run slug setup and file discovery in a single block (variables do not persist
between bash blocks):

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
mkdir -p ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG
echo "=== SLUG: $SLUG ==="
echo "=== Sprint logs ==="
ls -t ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/pm-sprint-*.json 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"
echo "=== Review logs ==="
cat ~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/*-reviews.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"
```

Remember the SLUG value output above — use it as a literal string in subsequent steps.

If the user specifies a sprint or issue number, filter to that sprint only.
Otherwise, report on all sprints (with summary aggregation).

---

## Step 2: Per-sprint breakdown

For each completed sprint, produce:

```
=== SPRINT REPORT: #<issue> — <title> ===
Type: <bug/feature/enhancement>
Branch: pm/issue-<N>
PR: #<pr-number>
Duration: <total> (plan: <t>, build: <t>, review: <t>, ship: <t>)

STAGE TIMELINE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Stage     Start    End      Duration  Status
  ──────── ──────── ──────── ──────── ────────
  Intake    14:30    14:31    1m        completed
  Plan      14:31    14:38    7m        completed
  Build     14:38    14:52    14m       completed
  Review    14:52    14:57    5m        completed
  Ship      14:57    14:59    2m        completed
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total                       29m

BUGS & ISSUES
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Found in self-check: 1 (caught by tests during build)
  Found in review:     3 (2 auto-fixed, 1 escalated)
  Total:               4
  Early detection:     100% (all caught before ship)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DECISIONS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total decisions:    8
  Auto-decided:       6 (75%)
  Escalated to CEO:   2 (25%)
    - Plan approval (mandatory)
    - Taste: DB index strategy (chose covering index)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SCOPE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Lines changed:      247 (+198 / -49)
  Files changed:      6
  Tests added:        4
  Coverage delta:     +2.3%
  Requirements met:   5/5 (100%)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

## Step 3: Cross-sprint analysis (if multiple sprints)

When reporting on multiple sprints, add aggregate analysis:

```
=== CROSS-SPRINT ANALYSIS ===
Period: <earliest sprint> to <latest sprint>
Sprints completed: <N>

EFFICIENCY TRENDS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Metric              Average    Best     Worst    Trend
  ─────────────────── ──────── ──────── ──────── ──────
  Total duration       14m      6m       32m      steady
  Plan stage           4m       2m       8m       improving
  Build stage          7m       3m       18m      steady
  Review stage         2m       1m       5m       steady
  Ship stage           1m       1m       2m       steady
  Lines per sprint     183      37       412      —
  Bugs per sprint      1.3      0        4        improving
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

BUG DETECTION EFFECTIVENESS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Where bugs are caught:
    Self-check (earliest): 22%  █████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
    Review (early):        78%  ████████████████░░░░░░

  Review is catching most bugs — good signal.
  [or: Self-check catching most — review may be redundant for simple issues.]
  [or: Review catching everything — self-check tests may need strengthening.]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DECISION PATTERNS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Auto-decided:         89% across all sprints
  Escalation rate:      11%
  Most common escalation type: taste decisions (scope/approach)
  CEO response time:    avg <t> per escalation
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

COMPLEXITY DISTRIBUTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Small (1-3 files):    40%  ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
  Medium (4-10 files):  45%  █████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░
  Large (10+ files):    15%  ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

---

## Step 4: Recommendations

Based on the data, provide actionable recommendations:

**If review is catching most bugs but self-check is not (>80% found in review):**
> "Review is doing the heavy lifting — 80% of bugs are found there, not in self-check. Consider:
> - Writing more targeted tests during the build phase to catch issues earlier
> - Adding /cso for security-sensitive changes
> - Improving test coverage in the build stage"

**If a particular stage is consistently slow:**
> "Build stage averages 18m — 2x longer than other stages. Common causes:
> - Plans may not be specific enough (ambiguous plans slow implementation)
> - Consider running /autoplan for medium+ complexity issues"

**If escalation rate is very low (<5%):**
> "Only 3% of decisions are escalated. This could mean:
> - The PM is handling things well (check bug escape rate to confirm)
> - OR the PM may be auto-deciding things that should be escalated
> Review the decision log for any questionable auto-decisions"

**If escalation rate is very high (>25%):**
> "28% of decisions are escalated. Consider:
> - Issues may have unclear requirements — improve issue templates
> - The PM's decision framework may be too conservative for this project"

---

## Step 5: Export option

After presenting the report, offer:

```
A) Done — thanks
B) Export to markdown — save report to ~/.gstack/projects/<slug>/pm-report-<date>.md
   (substitute the project slug resolved in Step 1)
C) Post to issue — add report as a GitHub issue comment
D) Drill into sprint #<N> — show full decision log
```

If the user chooses D, read the sprint log's `decision_log` array and present
each decision with its principle, rationale, and outcome.

---

## Important Rules

- **Data-driven, not opinionated.** Every number comes from sprint logs. Never estimate or guess.
- **Trends over snapshots.** One sprint's metrics are noise. Three sprints show a pattern. Caveat small sample sizes.
- **Actionable recommendations.** Don't just show data — tell the CEO what to do differently.
- **Respect the CEO's time.** Lead with the summary, details below. If everything looks good, say so.
- **Handle missing data gracefully.** If a sprint log is incomplete (e.g., no QA stage), note it and work with what's available.
- **Visual over verbal.** Use tables, bar charts (ASCII), and clear formatting. The CEO scans, they don't read paragraphs.
